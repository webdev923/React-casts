Selectors in Redux

1 - Selectors are useful for:
  a - Computing derived data
  b - Get stuff on normalized state tree (get by ID, for example)
  c - Isolate implementation from public API for getting state (Makes for easier refators & data tranfsormations)

2 - Computing Derived data:
  Example:
  {
    firstName: 'Cássio',
    lastName: 'Antonio',
    gender: 'Male',
    maritalStatus: 'Married'
  }

  Mr. Ms. Mrs.

  derives to: "Mr. Cássio Antonio"
