# ReactCasts

This repository has code and outlines for [ReactCasts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZkjWyyLvzWeoVWEpRemrDQ). All content (code samples, outlines, etc...) is organized into folders, starting with [`episode1`](https://github.com/cassiozen/ReactCasts/tree/master/episode1) and going from there.

# Request A Screencast

I have some ideas for topics to cover, but if you want to see some topics covered in a future screencast, I'd like to hear from you.

Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/cassiozen/ReactCasts/issues) with the `request a screencast` label and make sure to include a good description on what you want to see!

You can also participate by adding your reactions and contributing to the discussion on suggested topics: https://github.com/cassiozen/ReactCasts/issues/labels/request%20a%20screencast.

# Issues With Code, Documentation, etc...

If you see any problems with code, documentation, or anything else in this repository, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/cassiozen/ReactCasts/issues) with the `bug` label and I'll fix it as soon as I can. Pull requests are also welcome.

# Run Instructions

All the folders that start with `episode` (such as [`episode1`](https://github.com/cassiozen/ReactCasts/tree/master/episode1)) contain the outline and code samples for that episode, and all code samples can be built and run.

Unless otherwise specified in the `README.md` in the episode folder, the commands for building, testing and running simply use the `npm` tool.

- install packages: `npm install`
- run: `npm start`

# Acknowledgements

The ReactCasts series is heavily inspired by the original [Rails Casts](http://railscasts.com) series by Ryan Bates. He is the pioneer that has given shape to the format.

The format of this repository, including the usage of issues for requesting screencast was created by Aaron Schlesinger for the fantastic [Go in 5 minutes](https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes) screencast series.
