# Boring Forms in React

ReactCasts, episode 14.

If you're targeting modern browsers (anything newer than IE11, really), there are browser APIs to deal with form directly to get the filled data and make validation without making all of your fields controlled by React. You lose flexibility and cannot do a detailed, finely grained validation, but for big boring forms, that's what I've been doing lately.
